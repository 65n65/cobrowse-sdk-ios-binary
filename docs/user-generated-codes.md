## Implementation

These are the native-side requirements on iOS to initiate sessions using 6-digit codes. More info at <https://cobrowse.io/docs#user-generated-codes>

You may expose a small UI in your app for users to generate a 6-digit code that they pass to an agent over the phone or chat to initiate a session.

To setup user-initiated sessions:

1. Add the appropriate code below into a view controller in your app.
2. Hook up a trigger for the action (or call it programatically if you prefer).

#### Swift
```swift
import CobrowseIO

class ExampleViewController: UIViewController {
    var sessionController: CBIOViewController!

    @IBAction func startCobrowse(sender: UIBarButtonItem) {
        self.sessionController = CBIOViewController()
        self.navigationController?.pushViewController(self.sessionController, animated: true)
    }

    // ... the rest of your view controller
}
```

For a full example written in Swift, see our Listr sample app at: https://github.com/cobrowseio/Listr

#### Objective C
```objective-c
@import CobrowseIO;

@implementation ExampleViewController {
    CBIOViewController* sessionController;
}

-(IBAction) startCobrowse:(id)sender {
    sessionController = [[CBIOViewController alloc] init];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:sessionController animated:YES];
}

// ... the rest of your view controller

@end
```

Make sure you've hooked up a trigger for the `startCobrowse` IBAction that we've just added. Then head to <https://cobrowse.io/dashboard> and enter the 6 digit code that will be generated by your app when you trigger the action!
